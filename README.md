# Word Cloud Generation with Python

This repository contains a Python notebook demonstrating how to generate and customize word clouds using the `wordcloud` library in Python. The project utilizes a text file to create visual representations of the most prominent words.

## Objectives

- Learn to generate word clouds from text.
- Customize word cloud parameters such as background color, colormap, and maximum words.
- Experiment with word clouds in different shapes using mask images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab
- `wordcloud` library
- `matplotlib` library
- `numpy` library
- `PIL` library

## Instructions

1. Upload your text file (.txt) to your Google Drive.
2. Follow the instructions in the provided notebook to mount Google Drive and generate the word cloud.
3. Customize the word cloud parameters and experiment with mask images for creative shapes.
